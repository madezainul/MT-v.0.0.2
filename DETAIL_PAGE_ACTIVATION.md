# Purchase Requisition Detail Page - Activation Complete ✅

## Summary
The Purchase Requisition detail page has been successfully activated and is ready for testing on port 8002.

## Issues Fixed 🔧

### 1. **Layout Structure Fixed**
- **Problem**: Success/error messages and modal were outside layout fragment
- **Solution**: Moved all content inside `layout:fragment="content"`
- **Result**: Proper rendering within dashboard layout

### 2. **Null Safety Added**
- **Problem**: Template could fail with null values
- **Solution**: Added Elvis operator (`?:`) for safe null handling
- **Examples**: `${pr.totalItems ?: 0}`, `${item.criticalityDisplay ?: 'Standard'}`

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Solution**: Added conditional rendering and fallback values
- **Result**: Robust display even with incomplete data
